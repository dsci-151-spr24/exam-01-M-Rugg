## Rules

1.  Your solutions must be written up in the R Markdown (Rmd) file called `exam-01.Rmd`.
    This file must include your code and write up for each task.
    Your "submission" will be whatever is in your exam repository at the deadline.
    Commit and push the Rmd and the md outputs of that file.

2.  This exam is open book, open internet, closed other people.
    You may use any online or book based resource you would like, but you must include citations for any code that you use (directly or indirectly).
    You **may not** consult with anyone else about this exam other than the Professor or TA for this course.
    You cannot ask direct questions on the internet, or consult with each other, not even for hypothetical questions.

3.  You have until **[DUE DATE]** to complete this exam and turn it in via your personal Github repo - late work will **not** be accepted.
    Technical difficulties are **not** an excuse for late work - do not wait until the last minute to knit / commit / push.

4.  Each question requires a (brief) narrative as well as a (brief) description of your approach.
    You can use comments in your code, but do not extensively count on these.
    I should be able to suppress **all** the code in your document and still be able to read and make sense of your answers.
    See the first setup code chunk in your Rmd file to experiment with suppressing and revealing your code.

5.  Even if the answer seems obvious from the R output, make sure to state it in your narrative as well.
    For example, if the question is asking what is 2 + 2, and you have the following in your document, you should additionally have a sentence that states "2 + 2 is 4."

``` r
2 + 2
# 4
```

1.  You may only use `tidyverse` and `nycflights13` (and its dependencies) for this assignment. Your solutions may not use any other R packages.

## Academic Integrity Statement

*I, \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, hereby state that I have not communicated with or gained information in any way from my classmates or anyone other than the Professor or TA during this exam, and that all work is my own.*

**A note on sharing / reusing code:** I am well aware that a huge volume of code is available on the web to solve any number of problems.
For this exam you are allowed to make use of any online resources (e.g. StackOverflow) but you must explicitly cite where you obtained any code you directly use (or use as inspiration).
You are also not allowed to ask a question on an external forum, you can only use answers to questions that have already been answered.
Any recycled code that is discovered and is not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism.
All communication with classmates is explicitly forbidden.

## Getting help

You are not allowed to post any questions on the public community repo or the public questions channel on Slack.
Any questions about the exam must be asked in person in office hours or on Slack via direct message to the Professor or the TAs.
For quickest response we recommend that you start a direct message with the Professor and all the TAs so that whoever gets to it first can respond to you.

## Grading and feedback

The total points for the questions add up to 90 points.
The remaining 10 points are allocated to code style, commit frequency and messages, overall organization, spelling, grammar, etc.
There is also an extra credit question that is worth 5 points.
You will receive feedback as an issue posted to your repository, and your grade will also be recorded on Sakai.

## Logistics

Answer the questions in the document called `exam-01.Rmd`.
Add your code and narrative in the spaces below each question.
Add code chunks as needed.
Use as many lines as you need, but keep your narrative concise.

Before completing, make sure to supress the code and look over your answers one more time.
If the narrative seems sparse or choppy, edit as needed.
Then, revert back to revealing your code.

Don't forget that you will need to configure your user name and email for Git to be able to push to your repository.

## Packages

In addition to `tidyverse`, you will need the `nycflights13` package for the data.
You will first need to install these packages and then load them.

```{r packages_setup}
library(tidyverse)              #loads required packages
library(nycflights13)
```


## The data

The `nycflights13` package contains information about all flights that departed from NYC (e.g. EWR, JFK and LGA) in 2013.
The main data is in the `flights` data frame, but there are additional data sets which may help understand what causes delays, specifically:

-   `weather`: hourly meteorological data for each airport
-   `planes`: construction information about each plane
-   `airports`: airport names and locations
-   `airlines`: translation between two letter carrier codes and names

## Questions

1.  **Question 1 (10 points)** - What are the ten most common destinations for flights from NYC airports in 2013?
    Make a table that lists these in descending order of frequency and shows the number of fligts heading to each airport.

``` {r NYC_destinations_chart}

flights %>%
  count(dest) %>%                 #creates frequency table for destinations
  arrange(desc(n)) %>%            #arranges from greatest to
  filter(n > 9700)                #shows only the top 10 least
```

***I created a frequency table of the destinations of NYC flights in 2013 by using the `count()` function on the variable `dest` (destination). I then arranged the display from greatest to least using `arrange(desc(n))` where `n` is equal to the number of flights to a destination and filtered the data to only include values over `9700` (just under the 10th most frequent destination). (Since only the year 2013 is included in the dataset, year did not need to be separately filtered.)***

***The 10 most frequent destinations for NYC flights in 2013 in descending order are as follows: ORD (17283), ATL	(17215), LAX	(16174), BOS (15508), MCO	(14082), CLT (14064), SFO	(13331), FLL (12055), MIA (11728), and DCA (9705).***

2.  **Question 2 (10 points)** - Which airlines have the most flights departing from NYC airports in 2013?
    Make a table that lists these in descending order of frequency and shows the number of flights for each airline.
    In your narrative mention the names of the airlines as well.
    *Hint:* You can use the `airlines` dataset to look up the airline name based on `carrier` code.
    
I want to create another column in the dataset (mutate()).
     Using the carier code data from airlines
     Or...what if I mutated airlines instead?
     but it would be much cleaner if updated flights instead.

flights <- flights %>%
  left_join(airlines)           #adds airlines to the dataset
  #filter(is.na(name))              #checks that all carriers have a corresponding name

```
```{r flights_airline_frequency}

flights %>%
  count(name) %>%                     #creates frequency table
  arrange(desc(n))

```

***I first added the airline names to the `flights` dataset. To do this I used a `left.join()` to take the `name` column from `airlines` and add it to `flights`. This matched the `carrier` in `flights` to it in `airlines`. I then saved these changes to `flights` to make it accessible for later. In a separate chunk, I created a frequency table using the `count()` function. I then arranged it from greatest to least with `arrange(desc(n))`.***

***The airlines with the most flights out of NYC in 2013 are United Airlines Inc. (58,665), Jet Blue Airways (54,635), and ExpressJet Airlines Inc. (54,173).***

3.  **Question 3 (10 points)** - Consider only flights that have non-missing arrival delay information.
    Your answer should include the name of the carrier in addition to the carrier code and the values asked.

    a\.
    Which carrier had the highest mean arrival delay?
    
    ***Frontier Airlines Inc. (carrier: F9) had the highest mean arrival delay of 21.92 min. (See narrative and table below)***

    b\.
    Which carrier had the lowest mean arrival delay?
    
    ***Alaska Airlines Inc. (carrier: AS) had the lowest mean arrival delay of -9.93 min (aka. early by a mean of 9.93 min). (See narrative and table below.)***

```{r arrival_delays_carrier_highest}

flights %>%
  filter(!is.na(arr_delay)) %>%       #only includes data with non-missing arrival delay information
  group_by(name, carrier) %>%         #groups by airline name and includes the carrier code      
  summarise(mean_arr_delay = mean(arr_delay)) %>% #takes the mean of arr_delay
  arrange(desc(mean_arr_delay))%>%       #arranges from greatest to least
  filter(mean_arr_delay > 21 | mean_arr_delay < -9)         #only displays the highest and least mean arrival delay           
```

***First, I filtered out any rows from `flights` that were missing arrival delay information using `filter(!is.na(arr_delay))`. I then grouped the data (`group_by()`) by  `name` and `carrier`. This was done to ensure that both were included in the output. Since there are not any instances with the same value for `carrier` and a different one `name` or vice versa, the data could be grouped by either (or in this case both) variables with no difference in means. Using this grouped data, I calculated the mean  of `arr_delay` through the `summarise(mean())` functions and assigned the mean to the variable `mean_arr_delay`. To make the display table easier to understand, I organized the means from greatest to least with `arrange(desc(mean_arr_delay))`. I then observed the largest and smallest means (first and last rows). Finally, to clean up the output table, I filtered the data to only show the these two points by only including `mean_arr_delay` values over 21 (just below the largest mean) or under -9 (just above the smallest mean).***

4.  **Question 4 (10 points)** - What was the mean temperature at the origin airport on the day with the highest departure delay?
    Your answer should include the name of origin airport, the date with the highest departure delay, and the mean temperature on that day.

flights <- flights %>%
  mutate(date = make_date(year, month, day)) %>% #adds the date
  left_join(weather)                 #joins the two datasets keeping all instances of flights and adding the instances in weather that align with flights
```

```{r airport_max-delay_temps}

flights %>%
  select(origin, dep_delay, date) %>% #limits output to origin, departure delay time, and the date
  arrange(desc(dep_delay)) %>%              #organizes from longest to shortest delays
#JFK on 2013-01-09 had the longest departure delay of 1301 min.
  filter(dep_delay == 1301)                 #shows only the longest departure delay

```
``` {r average_temp}
flights %>%
  group_by(origin, date) %>%         #groups by origin airport and then date
  summarise(mean_daily_temp = mean(temp)) %>% #calculates the mean daily temp for the specific airport on that day
  filter(origin == "JFK", date == "2013-01-09") #shows only the day and airport that had the longest departure delay
```

***To make accessing and grouping by days easier later on, I first added a new variable called `date` by combining `year`, `month`, and `day` into a date-class variable. I then added the `weather` dataset to the `flights` using a left join to keep only the weather data that had flight data that corresponded to it and saved my changes to the `flights` dataset.*** 

***In the next chunk I found the origin and date of the flight with the longest departure time. To do this, I first limited my output to `origin`, `dep_delay`, and `date`. Next, I organized `flights` from longest to shortest departure delay by using `arrange(desc(dep_delay))` and recorded the largest `dep_delay` value (1301). Finally, to clean up the output I filtered the data to only include the longest departure delay by using `filter(dep_delay == 1301)`. On 2013-01-09, JFK had the longest departure delay of 1301 min.***

***In my last chunk I found the average temp for the airport with the longest departure delay on that day. To do this, I grouped `flights` by `origin` and then `date` to divide the data by days and departing airport. I then calculated the mean of `temp` using the `summarise(mean())` functions. Finally, I cleaned up the table output to only show the row with the highest departure delay by filtering for `origin == "JFK"` and `date == 2013-01-09`. On 2013-01-09, JFK had the longest departure delay of 1301 min and an average temperature of 44.56 F.***

5.  **Question 5 (15 points)** - Consider breaking the day into four time intervals: 12:01am-6am, 6:01am-12pm, 12:01pm-6pm, 6:01pm-12am.

    a\.
    Calculate the proportion of flights that are delayed at departure at each of these time intervals.

    b\.
    Comment on how the likelihood of being delayed change throughout the day?

6.  **Question 6 (15 points)** - Find the flight with the longest air time.

    a\.
    How long is this flight?

    b\.
    What city did it fly to?

    c\.
    How many seats does the plane that flew this flight have?

7.  **Question 7 (15 pts)** - The `airports` data frame contains information on a large number of primarily American airports.
    These data include location information for these airports in the form of latitude and longitude coordinates.
    In this question we limit our focus to the [Contiguous United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contiguous_United_States).
    Visualize and describe the distribution of the longitudes of airports in the Contiguous United States.
    What does this tell you about the geographical distribution of these airports?
    *Hint:* You will first need to limit your analysis to the Contiguous United States.
    [This Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_extreme_points_of_the_United_States) can help, but you're welcomed to use other resources as well.
    Make sure to cite whatever resource you use.

8.  **Question 8 (15 pts)** - Recreate the plot included below using the `flights` data.
    Once you have created the visualization, in no more than one paragraph, describe what you think the point of this visualization might be.
    *Hint:* The visualization uses the variable `arrival`, which is not included in the `flights` data frame.
    You will have to create `arrival` yourself, it is a categorical variable that is equal to `"ontime"` when `arr_delay <= 0` and `"delayed"` when `arr_delay > 0`.

![](img/plot-to-recreate.png)

**Extra Credit (5 pts)** - Create a visualization that effectively shows if there is a relationship between the average daily departure delay and the average daily temperature for all three New York city airports.
Your answer must be given in a single pipe.
(You should only spend time on this question once you have finished answering the others)
